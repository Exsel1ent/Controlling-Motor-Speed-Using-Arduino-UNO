# Controlling-Motor-Speed-Using-Arduino-UNO
This is one of the most important parts of my Final Year Project, my project is still in progress but in this part, I have been able to control the motor speed at 3000-5000 RPM with less than 1% error

1. the load for my test machine is a 1,5 ml test tube
2. the motor that I use has a maximum speed of 13000 RPM
3. The rotor that I use is a fixed angle type which has 6 holes
4. I use the infrared sensor as a tachometer to count the number of motor rotation
